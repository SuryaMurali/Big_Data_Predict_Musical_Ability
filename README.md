Project details:

• Performed penalizing adaptive lasso regression on a 4-dimensional matrix with 8000 predictors – big data

• Compared this model to ordinary least squares, ridge regression and principal components regression.

• Achieved a Root Mean Square Error of ~0.01, which coarsely means that the model is 99% accurate.
